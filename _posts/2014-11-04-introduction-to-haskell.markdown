title: Introduction to Haskell
description: Christian introduces the Haskell programming language from the basics to the its most used typeclasses
---

In the last years languages as Erlang, OCalm and Haskell, known as being mainly academic and used in restricted industries, have gained attention in the mainstream programming community. Functional programming promises new ways of coding, capable of solving in a terse and theoretically correct fashion many common programming problems.

Haskell is surely the purest functional language known by the public, and the most interesting one on the theoretical ground. It's purity guarantees to avoid side effects, while its code base, ground on category theory, assures to program using sound design principles.

In this short overview we will encompass the main parts of Haskell syntax and type system. This knowledge will be sufficient to understand the main Haskell libraries and tackle most of the problems the common programmer faces.

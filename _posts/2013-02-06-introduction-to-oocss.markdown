description: Second presentation meeting, Luca introduces the OOCSS approach
---

Last week we met for the first meeting about frontend development thematics. Luca Milan's objective was to explain the OOCSS (Object Oriented CSS) approach.

### OOCSS

How do you scale CSS for thousands of pages? Object Oriented CSS is an answer. It’s an approach for writing CSS that’s fast, maintainable, and standards-based. It adds much needed predictability to CSS so that even beginners can participate in writing beautiful websites.

### OOCSS Principles

The OOCSS approach has two main principles

* Separate structure and skin
This means to define repeating visual features (like background and border styles) as separate "skins" that you can mix-and-match with your various objects to achieve a large amount of visual variety without much code.
 
* Separate container and content
Essentially, this means “rarely use location-dependent styles”. An object should look the same no matter where you put it.

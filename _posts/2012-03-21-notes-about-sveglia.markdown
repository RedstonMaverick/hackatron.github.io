description: "Sveglia: a minimal countdown timer app"
---

[Sveglia][sveglia] is the first project under development by the [Hackatron team][team].

It'll be a minimal countdown timer app, a *super rad* tool to start counting time missing to every relevant event of your life: the conference you can't miss, your birthday, next milestone deadline.

One of the reasons why we chose Sveglia as our first project is that it's simple. Its simplicity will help us learning new technologies *on the road* without worrying about complex requirements.

Keep reading this blog to follow project's development progress, meanwhile here's a shot from our latest meeting:

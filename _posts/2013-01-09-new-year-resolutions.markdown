Yesterday we met for the first event of the year and we discussed about *Hackatron* itself.

As usual events will occur *every tuesday evening* at [Meme Coworking][meme] or at [Fungo Studios][fungo] but we slightly changed the format of the project:

1. meetings will divide in *themed meetings* and *free meetings*
1. event types will alternate weekly

### Themed meetings

These events will include a presentation on a topic previously selected by the team.

The only rule is that each themed meeting need some kind of output such:

* a presentation
* a blog post
* example code

Interesting topics emerged yesterday:

* [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/)
* [Nomic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomic)
* [Scala Programming Language](http://www.scala-lang.org/) and [Play Framework](http://www.playframework.org/)
* [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/)
* [elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/)
* [Erlang Programming Language](http://www.erlang.org/) and [Cowboy](https://github.com/extend/cowboy)

### Free meetings

These meetings are *free* as in *"free speech"*, not as in *"free beer"*.

We'll use these meetings to talk about topic submissions for next themed meetings and basically to meet and have fun.

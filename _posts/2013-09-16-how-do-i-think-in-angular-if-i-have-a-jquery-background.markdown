description: A starting point to help you to move from the jQuery world to AngularJS.

[Matteo](https://twitter.com/rosatimatteo) will talk about [**AngularJS**](http://angularjs.org/).

There's a set of logics you apply everyday using jQuery that you must trash in order to enter the frontend frameworks mindset and in particular AngularJS's one. The talk is a starting point to help you to move from the jQuery world to single page application frameworks.

AngularJS is an open-source JavaScript framework, maintained by Google. From angularjs.org:

> AngularJS is what HTML would have been, had it been designed for building web-apps.
>
> Declarative templates with data-binding, MVW, MVVM, MVC, dependency injection and great testability story all implemented with pure client-side JavaScript!

Matteo will introduce AngularJS, than with a couple of demos we'll go through bi-directional data binding, controllers, and other core parts of the framework.

We'll dive into real life examples to understand the core concept of **directives**, the common ground between AngularJS and jQuery world.

If you're passionate about frontend development **tomorrow at 7:00 PM at Serra (H-Farm)** you can't miss this event.

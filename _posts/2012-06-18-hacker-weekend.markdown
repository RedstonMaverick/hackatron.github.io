Last weekend part of the Hackatron team attended two great events: [RubyDay][rubyday] and [H-ack][h-ack].

At RubyDay we had a great time, we enjoyed talks such *"Rails Views for the OO-savvy Rubyist"* by [Elia Schito][elia] and *"Ruby Concurrency"* by [Marco Borromeo][borros].

The day after RubyDay, we attended the H-ack at *Digital Accademia* where we challenged other four teams in a *3-hours-hackaton* about sport events like UEFA Europa League and London 2012 Olympics.

We are proud to announce we won the competition with [From stadium][from-stadium], an experiment about soccer match events visualization.

Last born in Apple, [Apple Watch](https://www.apple.com/watch/) represents an entirely new line of products that Cupertino's company has put on the market.

[Mattia](http://mattiarigo.com/) and [Matteo](http://twitter.com/teomatteo89) present the concepts behind the Watch, the UI and the UX.
We'll see also an overview on the WatchKit Framework, distribuited by Apple to all developers to build amazing Watch Apps, and a quick demo app.

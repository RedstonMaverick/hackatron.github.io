This meeting, hold by David Santucci ([@davidsantucci](https://twitter.com/davidsantucci)), challenged the attenders with
three problems to be solved. The first to solve a problem got a nice gift sponsored by
H-Farm (2 t-shirts and a sweatshirt).

Here is the [slides](http://hackatron.org/slides/algorithm-challenges-2015-01-20.pdf) from David, enjoy!

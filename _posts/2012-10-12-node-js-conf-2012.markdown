title: "Node.js Conf 2012"
---

Saturday 10th of November me ([@johnnyaboh](http://twitter.com/johnnyaboh)) and Devis ([@batdevis](http://twitter.com/batdevis)) went to Brescia to attend the Node.js Conf 2012.

It's been a great opportunity to get a lot of useful advices and we met new and old friends.

There was **Max Bruning** talking about using DTrace and mdb to do in-situ and post-mortem debugging of real-time apps, **Glenn Block** and **Luciano Colosio** speaking about running your node.js app on *Windows Azure* infrastructure with an example showing *Save The Mom* app architecture.

**Felix Geisend√∂rfer** talked about javascript performances compared to C while developing the *MySQL driver for node.js* and gave an introduction to benchmarking and data analysis techniques.

**Sergi Mansilla**, **Richard Rodger** talked about node.js apps in production at large scale with products such as *Cloud9 IDE* and *businesspost.ie* and **Andrew Nesbitt** covered some ways to integrate different types of tools made with node with existing legacy applications.

We talked also about node.js and hardware integration with **Simone Chiaretta** and his open source underwater vehicle called *OpenROV* and internet of things with **Matteo Collina** about *qest.me*: a MQTT protocol broker written in javascript.

Honor mentions go to **Sam Reghenzi** who started a couple of flames with his shareable complains about node.js and **Golo Roden** with a talk about *empathic testing* using his new library [intent.js](http://github.com/goloroden/intent.js).

It's been great also to see Luca Lanziani ([@_Nss_](http://twitter.com/_Nss_)), Gianluca Stivan ([@yawnt](http://twitter.com/yawnt)) and Filippo De Pretto ([@filnik90](http://twitter.com/filnik90)).

Node.js is getting a lot of attention here in Italy thanks to events such the Node.js Conf and we're grateful to the guys at **WEBdeBS** who made this possible.

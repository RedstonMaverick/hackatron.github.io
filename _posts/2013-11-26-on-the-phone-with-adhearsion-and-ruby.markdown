title: On the phone with Adhearsion and Ruby
description: Luca talks about Adhearsion, a Ruby framework for voice applications that allows developers to easily build third party call control solutions.

The telephony world has been traditionally a realm of proprietary and arcane configuration systems.
Even the open source solutions such as Asterisk are difficult to interface with other applications to control calls and share data.

Enter [Adhearsion](http://adhearsion.com/), a Ruby framework for voice applications that allows developers to easily build third party call control solutions.
Leveraging the power of the language and gems, an Adhearsion application has a clean and consistent syntax and can interact with any other system or service.

We will be exploring with [Luca Pradovera](https://twitter.com/lucaprado) the basic layout of a voice application and some interesting solutions to integrate with an existing Rails app.ï»¿

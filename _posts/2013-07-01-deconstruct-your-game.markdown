[Nicola](https://twitter.com/breezeight) and [Gianpaolo](https://twitter.com/GianpyGreco) are organizing an event about **game deconstruction**.

If you're passionate about game development and design tomorrow at 6:30 PM at Serra (H-Farm) you can't miss "Deconstruct your game".

We'll *deconstruct* a game trying to understand its fundamental mechanics and then we'll try to apply them to other environments. This technique is called game deconstruction.

The meeting is composed by three steps and attendants will split into groups.

Schedule:

* short introduction about game deconstruction and game design base concepts
* step 1: deconstruct a game with support by Nicola and Gianpaolo
* step 2: pitch sessions about deconstruction products
* step 3: apply mechanics to other systems or environments

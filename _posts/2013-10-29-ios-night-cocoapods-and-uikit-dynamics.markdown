Do you have an awesome application and would you like to bring its architecture to the next level? [Fabio](http://twitter.com/fabiopelosin)'s experiences and lessons learned from working on **CocoaPods**. Making Pods is important for your applicationâ€™s maintainability and factoring out code with them, even for internal use, might be what you are looking for.

Fabio Pelosin is a software and strategy enthusiast deeply in love with the fascinating changes of technology. In the Objective-C world Fabio has taken CocoaPods to the next level, applying his business management studies to the cacophony of a large community; while keeping the community focussed on the loving spirit of the OSS world.

**UIKit Dynamics** lets you mimic real-world effects such as gravity in your animations.

[Renzo](http://twitter.com/rgpretto) is an iOS developer since 2009. He is co-founder of [#pragma mark](http://pragmamark.org/) association.
